    <P>HTML5 (Hypertext <b><a href="./markup languague.html">Markup Language</a></b> 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It was the fifth and final major HTML version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Stand4]ard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group <strong><a href="./whatwg.html">(WHATWG)</a></strong>, a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).<br><br>

        HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without <a href="./xhtml.html">XHTML</a> 's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only <a href="./html4.html"> HTML 4</a> but also XHTML1 and even the DOM Level 2 HTML itself.<br><BR>
        
        HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and <a href="./api.html">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.<br>
