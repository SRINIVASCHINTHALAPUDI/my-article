    <h2>(Hyper Text Markup Languague )</h2>
    <P>HyperText <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">Markup Language</a> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS )</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"> JavaScript</a>.</P>

<h2><U>Description</U></h2>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br><br>

    
    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p> 1980, physicist <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry<H5> <a href="./HISTORY.HTML"> read more</a></H5></p>
